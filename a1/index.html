	<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
	<!--Required: 2 paragraphs about myself.-->
	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>My name is <strong>Alex Moriarty</strong>. I study Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Dalhousie University. I have recently taken interest in the field of Autonomous Robotics. I am looking at options for studying in Germany or Canada after graduating. In the past year, I have competed in robotics competitions internationally as part of the b-it-bots team out of Bonn, Germany. This year, I have joined DalRobotics: Intelligent Ground Vehicle Team. 
	</p>
	<p>
	My non-academic interests include: cycling, skiing, longboarding and sailing. Outside of class and work I still enjoy coding and working on projects with friends.
	There was a time when I would do a little bit of web development for friends. 
	That changed when I was hired to do backend web development. 
	I still do some hosting but I have switched all websites I maintained over to Drupal and am now switching them to Wordpress as I get lazier.</p>
